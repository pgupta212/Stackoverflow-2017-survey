### Installation
Install Anaconda distribution 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html  
Other than Anaconda distribution of python, no other liraries are required to run the code.  

### Motivation
Each year, stack overflow run this survey to understand developer community about their favorite technologies, coding habits, and work preferences, as well as how they learn, share, and level up. These results are useful to improve developersâ€™ lives. Therefore, in this project I would like to understand following:  
* Where do most Stack Overflow users/Developers come from?  
* Which IDE is popular amongst Developers?  
* What Developers value the most when considering a new Job?  

### File Structure
* `Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey.ipynb` - jupyter Notebook that contains analysis to showcase the work related to the above questions  
* `survey-results-public.csv` - Stackoverflow 2017 survey data  
* `survey-results-schema.csv` - Stackoverflow 2017 survey schema  

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@pgupta212.m/what-can-we-learn-from-the-stackoverflow-survey-2150e98091e9)
